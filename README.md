# 🚀 RevUnity: Decentralized Group Arbitrage for Everyone


👋 Welcome to RevUnity, a platform that democratizes DeFi arbitrage. We leverage the power of Aave's flashloans and Reveel's revenue distribution protocol to create a collaborative and profitable platform for all.

## 💡 Features

**👥 Group Flashloan Arbitrage:** RevUnity allows users to form groups and perform arbitrage trades across various DeFi platforms using Aave's flashloans. This allows us to take advantage of price discrepancies in real-time, generating profits without the need for upfront capital.

**💰 Revenue Sharing:** Profits generated from the arbitrage trades are not kept in-house. Instead, we use Reveel's trustless and composable protocol to distribute the revenue among the group members. This means that you earn a share of the profits simply by being a part of a group.

**🌐 Inclusive Platform:** RevUnity is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their capital or technical knowledge. Our platform does all the heavy lifting, allowing you to benefit from DeFi arbitrage opportunities with ease.

**🔒 Trustless and Autonomous:** All revenue paths in RevUnity are created as independent entities using Reveel, requiring no external maintenance to operate. This ensures that the distribution process is completely trustless and autonomous.

**⛽ Gas-Optimal:** With Reveel's gas-optimal distribution strategy, you can be assured that more of your profits go into your pocket, not on gas fees.

## 🚀 How it Works

1. **👥 Join or Create a Group:** To get started, simply join an existing group or create a new one. There's no minimum investment, making it accessible to everyone.

2. **💹 Group Performs Arbitrage Trades:** Each group continuously monitors multiple DeFi platforms for arbitrage opportunities. When an opportunity is detected, the group uses Aave's flashloans to perform the arbitrage trade.

3. **💸 Revenue Distribution:** The profits from the arbitrage trades are then distributed among the group members using Reveel's revenue distribution protocol. The distribution is done automatically and trustlessly, ensuring fairness and transparency.

4. **💰 Withdraw Your Profits:** You can withdraw your share of the profits at any time. With Reveel, you can withdraw funds from a single or across multiple revenue paths together.
